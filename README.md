## Welcome!

I'm Marjorie, currently a Master's student in Electrical Engineering. I do some projects with Machine Learning but I also like to do some random projects in Python. Here are some of my projects: 

### [Design of experiments (DOE) in magnetic characterisation tests](https://github.com/marjoriehoegen/analise-ensaios-tcc)

Final undergraduate research project focused on the application of DOE to determine which factors are significant in the measurement of permeability and magnetic losses of electrical steels. Experimental data were obtained with characterisation tests of electrical steels using Epstein Frame and SST (Single Sheet Tester).
